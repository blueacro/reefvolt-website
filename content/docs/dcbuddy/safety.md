Before and while using the DCBuddy or DCBuddy Split Aquarium Power Center,
please remember and follow these *Important Safety Notices*.

1. Do not immerse the DCBuddy in water or expose to water splashes. The DCBuddy
   is not water proof and should be kept in a dry equipment area.
2. Do not expose DCBuddy to freezing or high heat conditions outside of the
   range of 32F to 90F.
3. Do not use DCBuddy in an environment which is condensing (moisture forming on
   surfaces)
4. Pay attention to the power supply used for DCBuddy. Do not exceed 40V input
   DC.
5. All connectors are center-positive. When using external supplies, only use
   power supplies which are center-positive if they use a barrel jack.
6. The left-side connectors of the DCBuddy are *input connectors only*.
7. Only connect *one power supply* to DCBuddy. The DCBuddy Hub can be used for
   redundant supplies.
8. Only use power supplies which are self-protected and overload protected.
9. Only use UL, ETL or TUV listed power supplies. We recommend only using
   Meanwell power supplies.
10. DCBuddy is not a toy and not suitable for children.
11. Do not operate any appliance if it has a damaged cord or plug, if it is
    malfunctioning or if it is dropped or damaged in any manner.
12. Never yank cord to pull plug from outlet. Grasp the plug and pull to disconnect.
13. Danger: To avoid possible electrical shock, special care should be taken
    since water is employed in the use of aquarium equipment.
14. If an extension cord is necessary, a cord with a proper rating should be
    used. A cord rated for less amperes or watts than the appliance rating may
    overheat. Care should be taken to arrange the cord so that it will not be
    tripped over or pulled.
