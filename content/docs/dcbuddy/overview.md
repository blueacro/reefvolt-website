Safely replace multiple AC-DC power bricks for VorTech, Gyre, ReefWave, Protein
Skimmers and other DC pumps and loads in your aquarium with the DCBuddy. DCBuddy
is compatible with 12V, 24V, 32V and 36V equipment.

Works with Home Assistant. Per-port power control and current monitoring.

Each DCBuddy can replace up to 7 AC-DC power adapters or bricks at one voltage
(either 12V, 24, 32V or 36V) using one large, industrial power supply (power
supply not included). The DCBuddy Split supports 4 outlets at the input voltage,
and 3 outlets at a fixed 12V or 24V (configurable with a jumper).

For example, the following equipment is well suited with DCBuddy:
- DC pumps, such as Gyres, Vortechs, etc
- ATO pumps
- Aquarium controllers
- Small refuge lighting or other accessory lighting
- Fans

The voltage chosen depends on the equipment you are powering:

- Many DC pumps are 24V (Gyres, MP10wQDs, many skimmer DC pumps).
- Some DC pumps are 32V (VorTech MP40wQD) and will also operate at 24V, but may not reach 100% peak flow.
- Larger DC pumps are 36V (Vectra, main return pumps)

All ports of this model will operate at the same voltage - please ensure the
compatibility and use the right supply. 

## Features and Specifications

- Maximum total current of 10A input (approximately 240W @ 24V, 120W @ 12V). 

- Per port 3A max sustained, 5A peak current (approximately 72W @ 24V).

- All ports are short circuit, over-current and over-load protected @ 5A.

- Uses standard 2.1mm x 5.5mm barrel jacks as output ports. Cables not included
  (sold here, and commonly available from other sources). Some equipment
  requires 2.5mmx5.5mm barrel jacks, of which the "forked" kind of 2.5mm cables
  are compatible.

- WiFi connected to Home Assistant or local web server, including per-port on/off control and current monitoring. No clouds.

- Integrated status display (OLED)

- Open Source Hardware and Firmware: firmware update over OTA or USB-C.

- Works with upcoming DCBuddy Battery and DCBuddy Multiple-Voltage Redundant Input Hub!

Multiple power input options.
